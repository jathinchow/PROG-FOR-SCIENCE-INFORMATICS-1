## Required Software:
R (version 4.0 or higher recommended): Download and install from CRAN.
RStudio (optional, but recommended): Provides an integrated development environment for running and editing R scripts.

## Data Files
- Gene_Expression_Data.xlsx: Contains gene expression data.
- Gene_Information.csv: Contains gene information.
- Sample_Information.tsv: Contains sample information with phenotypes.

## Steps
1. Load the data files into R.
2. Change sample names based on phenotype.
3. Merge data and split based on phenotype.
4. Compute average expression for all genes.
5. Determine log2 fold change for each probe.
6. Identify genes with fold change magnitude > 5.
7. Add column for higher expression in Normal or Tumor samples.
8. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
9. Create visualizations (histograms, bar chart, heatmap, clustermap).
