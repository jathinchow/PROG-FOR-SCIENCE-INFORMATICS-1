Description: This repository contains R scripts to process and analyze a DNA sequence from the file chr1_GL383518v1_alt.fa. The tasks include reading the sequence, generating the reverse complement, and analyzing nucleotide counts in kilobase-sized segments.

## Required Software:
R (version 4.0 or higher recommended): Download and install from CRAN.
RStudio (optional, but recommended): Provides an integrated development environment for running and editing R scripts.

## Instructions to run:
1. Ensure you have R installed on your system.
2. Place the sequence file `chr1_GL383518v1_alt.txt` in the working directory.
3. Run the provided R scripts in the order specified.

## Files created
- `sequence_analysis.R`: Contains all the R scripts for the tasks.
- `results.txt`: Outputs from the scripts, including specific letters and nucleotide counts.

## Expected Results
- The 10th and 758th letters of the sequence.
- The 79th letter and a segment from the reverse complement.
- Nucleotide counts per kilobase and analysis of discrepancies.
